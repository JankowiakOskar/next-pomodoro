# Pomodoro Timer ⏰
Pomodoro it's a technique witch is using to improve menaging your time and keep mind on focus. Your focus section (pomodoro) has 25 minutes, and you can use it to focus on learning, reading or anything you want, after that you have 5 minutes break (short break) and if you complete 3-4 session of pomodoro you would make a 15 minutes break (long break). Ofc if you want you can set custom timers. Enjoy!✌
